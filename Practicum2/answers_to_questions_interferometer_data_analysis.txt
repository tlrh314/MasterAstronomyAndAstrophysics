Answers to questions
10) Filename = 'listobs_vraag10.log'
10 a) What are the sources that have been observed? Find out which one of them are the calibrators?
There are ten sources observed:  J1331+3030, J1822-0938, 3C391 C1, 3C391 C2, 3C391 C3, 3C391 C4, 3C391 C5, 3C391 C6, 3C391 C7, J0319+4130

Based on the name of the dataset, I deducted that this observations probably consists of a mosaic observation of a source. Therefore, I will assume the actual observed source should be 3C391 since there are seven seemingly different observations in very close vicinity of one another. It stands to reason that  the other three sources could very well be the calibration sources: J1331+3030, J1822-0938, and J0319+4130. The reason to use three sources could, for instance be, to calibrate the amplitude, phase, and flux using one source for each parameter.

10 b) How many antennas have been used in the observation? What were their dimensions?
 The number of antennas is 26. All of the antennas are 25.0 meter in diameter, which I assume are the dimensions asked for in this question.

10 c) What was the total observation duration? How many sky fields have been observed? How many different sources were present and why the two numbers don’t coincide in your opinion?

The total integration time is 28671.5 seconds, which is almost 8 hours. The number of sky fields is ten, of which three are calibration source sky fields, and seven make up the source mosaic. This means that probably four different sources were present assuming that one sky field contains at most one source, but there could be multiple (unresolved) sources per skyfield.

16) From the plot in question 10 we can see the outermost station names are ea18, ea01, and ea03. So we can then obtain the baselines between ea18 - ea01, ea01 - ea03, ea03 - ea18 by looking at the East and North positions from the logfile saved in question 10. By using Pythagoras theorem we can obtain three baseline values  1031.18, 971.11, and 967.096. Now we can see that the largest baseline B is 1031.8.

From the lecture 6 slide 6 we obtain the equation theta = lambda/B. Again from the logfile from question 10 we obtain Ch0 (MHz), the starting frequency of the dataset lambda is 4536.000 MHz. The channel width ChanWid (kHz) is 2000.000, so the central frequency of the channel is Ch0 + ChanWid/2.

We obtain lambda = 3e8/(1031.18m*(4536 MHz + 1000 kHz)) = 6.4e-5 radians, or 13.227 arc seconds.

17) Plot 5 only uses field in the header 'data' set equal to 3. This means that only a single sky field is shown (number 3), which is one of the parts of the mosaic. This is in contrast to plot 4, where all sources are shown, including the calibration sources.

18) For this we take a look at the CASA User Reference & Cookbook (http://casa.nrao.edu/Doc/Cookbook/casa_cookbook.pdf).

According to the cookbook: "UVwave -- Projected baseline separations in units of the observing wavelength (lambda, not kilolambda). UVDist_L is a function of frequency, and therefore, there will be a different data point for each frequency channel."

19) Here, in the Amp vs. Antenna1 plot, it looks as if number 10 is not working because the amplitude seems to be like 0.02 in contrast to the other antennas that have an amplitude of roughly 0.5.

7) The antennas ea13 (11th from left, on x-axis at 10) and ea15 (13th from left, on x-axis at 12) is now marked red.
Furthermore, the full amplitude we already had is plotted blue. But now in purple a lower amplitude is reached. This might
be due to the flagging of the first ten seconds required for the antenna to stabilize. At least I hope so.

gencal(vis='3c391_ctm_mosaic_10s_spw0.ms', caltable='3c391_ctm_mosaic_10s_spw0.antpos', caltype='antpos', spw="", antenna="", pol="", parameter=[])

3)
caltable = The new/existing calibration table
caltype='antpos'
    For antenna position corrections (caltype=’antpos’), the antenna  
    position offsets are specified in the ITRF frame. For EVLA, automated  
    lookup of the antenna position corrections is enabled when antenna is  
    unspecified (antenna=’’) for this caltype. Note that this requires  
    internet connection to access the EVLA antenna position correction  
    site.  
    For VLA position corrections in the VLA-centric frame, use  
    caltype=’antposvla’, and gencal will rotate them to ITRF before  
    storing them in the output caltable.  
spw=''
    Spectral window selection for specified parameters.  
    default: spw=’’ (specified parameters apply to all spws)  
antenna=''
    Antenna selection for specified parameters.  
    default: antenna=’’ (specified parameters apply to all antennas)  
pol=''
    Polarization selection for specified parameters.  
    default: pol=’’ (specified parameters apply to all polarizations)  
parameter=[]
    The calibration parameters, specified as a list, to  
    store in the caltable for the spw, antenna, and pol  
    selection.  The required length of the list is  
    determined by the caltype and the spw, antenna, pol  
    selection.  One "set" of parameters (e.g., one value  
    for ’amp’, ’ph’, etc., three values for ’antpos’)  
    specified the same value for all indicated spw, antenna,  
    and pol.  
    OR,  
    When specifying a long list of calibration parameter values,  
    these should be ordered first (fastest) by pol (if pol!=’’),  
    then by antenna (if antenna!=’’), and finally (sloweset) by  
    spw (if spw!=’’).  Unspecified selection axes must not be  
    enumerated in the parameter list

From the documentation:
    Antenna position corrections (in the traditional VLA-centric  
    frame) will be introduced in meters for  
    antenna ea09 (dBx=0.01, dBy=0.02, dBz=0.03) and for  
    antenna ea10 (dBx=-0.03, dBy=-0.01, dBz=-0.02)  
    These offsets will be rotated to the ITRF frame before  

So, the three fields are, respectively, dBx, dBy, dBz. The minimal value is 0.000000. The maximum dBx = -0.02570, dBy = 0.00450, dBz = -0.01900. These values are in meters. ITRF stands for International Terrestrial Reference Frame.

In the listobs() output we see three calibration objects identified by their field names. We have Googled these and found 
http://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=EVLA_Continuum_Tutorial_3C391, where we see J1331+3030 corresponds to 3C286. This is the only 3C-name for which we have a model in the setjy output, so here I will assume this is the model to be used. The model name consists of the sourcename dash a letter that corresponds to the frequency band. According to http://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php?title=EVLA_Continuum_Tutorial_3C391 in the IEEE system our observed frequency of 4536.000 MHz correspons to the C band. It is concluded that we should use the model 3C286_C.im

3) The amplitude calibrator is J1331+3030. The field ID (from listobs)

The output is:

a) find out what is the flux density for channel 0 for every Stoke’s parameter? 
Stokes Parameter I: 7.68301298 Jy
Stokes Parameter Q: 0. Jy

Stokes Parameter V: 0. Jy

b) Find out which spectral window is used? For this window an output of scaling values for every channel corresponding to the Stoke’s parameter is given. Here, what is the maximum and minimum flux density scale ?

So, the spectral window used is 0. The maximum is 7.81908 and the minimum 7.68301

c) Find the phase offset of image w.r.t amplitude calibrator. 
The model image's reference pixel is 0.00302169 arcsec from J1331+3030's phase center.
